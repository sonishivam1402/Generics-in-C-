Here, we can see it shows error because its type dependent.

<h2>Why Generics ?</h2>
Generics allows us to make classes and methods : 
<ul>
<li>Type independent </li>
<li>Type safe </li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Generics ? </h3>
Generics in C# are a feature that allows you to define classes, methods, interfaces, and other types with a placeholder for the data type. <br>
This means you can write code that works with any data type while maintaining type safety and without sacrificing performance.
